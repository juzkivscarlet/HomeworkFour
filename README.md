# Homework Four - "jQuery Assignment"

Homework assignment #4 for CWRU Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I call this project __YouTuber Musician Fight!__

*This readme is currently in progress, as are some of the files for the project. Both will be updated upon project completion.*

## Description

The example provided for this assignment was a Star Wars RPG game. I decided to base my assignment on musicians I follow on YouTube.

This project utilizes Bootstrap and jQuery. In addition, certain images were manipulated using an image manipulation program called Gimp.

## How this works

*details coming*

## File contents

* __"~/assets/"__ for media files, including images, audio files, fonts, etc.

    * All files cropped using Gimp image editor.
  * __"~/assets/fightimgs/"__ for images of characters used in gameplay. Essentially these are the same images found in *"~/assets/faces"*, but attached to an image of a stick figure.
    * All files are created in Gimp.
